# casa
Home Automation stack based on [homeassistant](home-assistant.io).

In the past, I orchestrated everything through [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) including auxillary systems such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and more.
**2021-11-12: I've recently switched over to using the [Home Assistant Operating System](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system) running on [Home Assistant Blue](https://www.home-assistant.io/blue). I'm still in the process of updating this repo to reflect those changes.**

**I maintain this purely for fun (favoring speed and exploration over quality and documentation). Consider this a reference/demo rather than a re-usable solution**

# Screenshots

The main interface is build in [appdaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DASHBOARD_CREATION.html) (with some customizations) and displayed on wall-mounted iPad minis around the house (the first iPad has been continuously running for over 4 years without issues).

 With the introduction of [lovelace](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/) in home-assistant more recently, I'm evaluating whether to replace the appdaemon interface with lovelace.

| [node-sonos-http-api](https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api) | HTTP API bridge for Sonos speakers. Filled some gaps in sonos features that HomeAssistant didn't support in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/)                                  | When I started out, I used Monit for simple monitoring but I quickly required more elaborate monitoring capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Sensu](https://sensu.io/)                                          | I migrated from Monit to Sensu for monitoring but over time that ended up consuming way too much CPU and memory which tended to slow my whole stack down. Currently on Prometheus.                                                                                                                             |
| [InfluxDB](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb)                    | Time series database used to persistently store sensor and monitoring data. Stopped using it because Prometheus is already providing everything I needed and InfluxDB was adding too much overhead, contributing to high CPU utilization.                                                                      |
| [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack)                             | Log Aggregation, Search Indexing, web dashboard. Didn't use it a lot and uninstalled it because it required too much memory and CPU for my liking.                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Slack](https://slack.com/)                                         | Used for sending notifications from [Home Assistant]([Slack](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/slack/)) when certain events occurred around the house. I've now switched to sending notifications directly to the [Home Assistant Mobile App](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app/) |


# General Notes

- Since my family's mother tongue is Dutch, you'll see some Dutch language used here and there (mostly in the user-facing parts).
- I have no idea how much time I've spend getting to this point, but I'm fairly certain it's a couple of hundreds of hours at least. Spread over about 5 years.
- I've never done a calculation of how much the current setup has cost me, but I'd guess it's about 3000-5000 EUR, some of which was spent on gear I no longer use. Note that it also highly depends on how you calculate things. Do you account for a (smart) TV? What about smart audio speakers? An old laptop that you had still lying around that you use as a server? Light bulbs you needed to buy anyways but you bought smartbulbs instead? etc. 
- If you're new to home-automation and want to do something similar to this, I recommend getting a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) (get the latest model with the most compute power) and installing [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) on it. Then get yourself a set of [Ikea Tradfri](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20411562/) smart light bulbs and start playing!

# Future Work
There's always more to automate!

- Siding curtains ([in-progress](projects/curtain-opener/README.md))
- ~~Automated window opening~~ (✅[done](https://jorisroovers.com/posts/window-opener))
- Window blinds (in addition to curtains, maybe?)
- Doorlocks
- Doorbell
- Sense Infuser? 
- Garden irrigation
- Improved presence detection
- Improved voice commands
- Upgrade network gear
- ~~Replace macbook server with something more suited (although it works well...)~~ (✅[done](https://twitter.com/jorisroovers/status/1423577362961256448))
- Only use zwave/zigbee (no WiFi) to interact with sensors (In Progress)
