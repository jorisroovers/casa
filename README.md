Home Automation stack based on [homeassistant](https://home-assistant.io).

In 2021 I've switched over to using the [Home Assistant Operating System](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system) running on [Home Assistant Blue](https://www.home-assistant.io/blue). Before, I orchestrated everything through [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) including auxillary systems such as [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and more. If this is something you're interested in, have a look at the [legacy](legacy/) directory.

**I maintain this purely for fun (favoring speed and exploration over quality and documentation). Consider this a reference/demo rather than a re-usable solution**

# Screenshots

The main interface is build in [lovelace](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/) and displayed on wall-mounted iPad minis around the house (the first iPad has been continuously running for over 4 years without issues).

For 4 years, I used a wallmount focussed dashboard build in [appdaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DASHBOARD_CREATION.html) - see [legacy](legacy/). I'm still in the process of building out good Lovelace-based dashboards.

| [Aqara Remote Switch](https://www.aqara.com/eu/wireless_remote_switch.html) | [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) | I have both the sincle rocker and dual-rocker models. I really like these, they're very responsive and they have a great physical click effect. I prefer the EU models over the Chinese variant: it has rounded corners and a slightly better clicky-feeling. |
| [Ikea Tradfri 5 button switch](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-remote-control-00443130/) | [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) | While it's great to have more buttons to be able to cycle through different presets as well as toggle light, in my experience these switches are sometimes non-responsive or very slow which can be frustrating. I'm moving away from them. |
| [Sonoff SNZB-01 Switch](https://sonoff.tech/product/smart-home-security/snzb-01/) | [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) | Simple single button switch. Works well.                     |

## Retired Software

My setup has changed dramatically over the years, and was simplified a lot with the my adoption of the [Home Assistant Operating System](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/). A lot of the items listed below were part of my [legacy](legacy/) setup.


| Software                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [HADashboard](http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/DASHBOARD_INSTALL.html) | Part of [appdaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that allows for easy creation of dashboards for Home Assistant that are intended to be wall mounted (optimized for distance viewing). |
| [node-sonos-http-api](https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api) | HTTP API bridge for Sonos speakers. Filled some gaps in sonos features that HomeAssistant didn't support in the past. |
| [Monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/)                           | When I started out, I used Monit for simple monitoring but I quickly required more elaborate monitoring capabilities. |
| [Sensu](https://sensu.io/)                                   | I migrated from Monit to Sensu for monitoring but over time that ended up consuming way too much CPU and memory which tended to slow my whole stack down. |
| [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)                         | For a long time I ended up using Prometheus to collects metrics on various components of my stack, and alerts when certain conditions are (not) met. Today, I don't do explicit monitoring anymore: the stack has become stable enough that the maintenance overhead of running prometheus is no longer worth it.<br />As part of my Prometheus stack, I also used [Alert Manager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/), [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), [Process Exporter](https://github.com/ncabatoff/process-exporter), [Blackbox Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).  I also wrote a custom [prom2hass](legacy/roles/homeassistant/templates/prom2hass.py) script for synching metrics and alerts between Home Assistant and Prometheus. |
| [Sanity tests](https://github.com/jorisroovers/casa/tree/master/legacy/tests) | Small set of python tests that ran every 5 min against the setup that check for some common problems and misconfigurations. These were great to catch issues when I've made changes to the setup. These tests were implement using [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/). |
| [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack)                      | Log Aggregation, Search Indexing, web dashboard. Didn't use it a lot and uninstalled it because it required too much memory and CPU for my liking. |
| [Slack](https://slack.com/)                                  | Used for sending notifications from [Home Assistant]([Slack](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/slack/)) when certain events occurred around the house. I've now switched to sending notifications directly to the [Home Assisanta Mobile App](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app/). |
| [Seshat](https://github.com/jorisroovers/seshat)             | Simple set of script(s) in typescript that aggregate some metrics from InfluxDB into more interesting statistics that I can display in grafana. These run every minute via a cronjob. |
| [roofcam](https://github.com/jorisroovers/roofcam)           | Simple custom python program to determine whether my flat roof has any water on it (which means the draining pipes are clogged up). Uses very simple image manipulations on screenshots to determine this. At some point I'd like to do something more advanced with ML, but the current script already is ~85% accurate on test data. Don't always have this program running. |
| [Backups](legacy/roles/backups)                              | Set of scripts that do periodic backups of some personal data and copy the resulting tarballs over to a Samba/CIFS network share. Each backup script also has an accompanying monitoring script that periodically verifies whether the last backup was successful. |

# Additional Notes

- I have no idea how much time I've spend getting to this point, but I'm fairly certain it's a couple of hundreds of hours at least. Spread over  5+ years.
- I've never done a calculation of how much the current setup has cost me, but I'd guess it's about 3000-5000 EUR, some of which was spent on gear I no longer use. Note that it also highly depends on how you calculate things. Do you account for a (smart) TV? What about smart audio speakers? An old laptop that you had still lying around that you use as a server? Light bulbs you needed to buy anyways but you bought smartbulbs instead? etc.
- If you're new to home-automation and want to do something similar to this, I recommend getting a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/) (get the latest model with the most compute power) and installing [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) on it. Then get yourself a set of [Ikea Tradfri](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20411562/) smart light bulbs and start playing! As a next step, you can consider getting a [Home Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow). 
- Since my family's mother tongue is Dutch, you'll see some Dutch language used here and there (mostly in the user-facing parts).

# Future Work

- ~~Only use zwave/zigbee (no WiFi) to interact with sensors (✅done)~~

# Uploading new version

Instructions (for myself) when uploading latest homeassistant config.

```sh
# Copy all files from homeassistant shared dir to this repo dir
cp -R /opt/shared/homeassistant/* /opt/shared/repos/casa

# Cleanup files we don't want in here (make sure to add new files using `git add` first)

# Dry Run (= -n)
git clean -fxdn

# Actual deleting ignored (and non-staged) files/dirs
git clean -fxd
```
